### PROJECT DETAILS

The first main goal was to understand how django works on background. The model-viwe-template way of rendering pages by paths. 

Then we started by the principle of DRY don't repeat yourself, refactoring the entire code to fufill this principle.

With a pre made page design, started from making the page responsive to paths rendering the templates in each part of project by creating an App with Views and Urls. Then started to create Modules to communicate with sqlite Database and render DB data on template dynamically.

After that worked on styling admin page and auth, by creating a new user page, login page and logout logic.
